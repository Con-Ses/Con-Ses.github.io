    "content": "In this project I co-led the design of a tilt-wing eVTOL UAV. I authored a custom MATLAB flight performance model and conducted aerodynamic trade studies in OpenVSP, VSPAero, and XFLR5. The final configuration reduced induced drag by 6% compared to the baseline. This work also included CAD modeling and structural design in SolidWorks, as well as team collaboration in an undergraduate aerospace design environment."

    "content": "I designed and built an RC EDF jet using SolidWorks for CAD and my Ender 5 S1 3D printer for parts. The intake geometry transitions from an elliptical cross-section to a circular fan duct to minimize flow separation. This project improved my knowledge of intake design, additive manufacturing, and foam construction techniques."
